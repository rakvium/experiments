Simple script which searches for all files on your disks and collects info to a sqlite database.

So, now, when i've already finished with collecting files, just have to log in to my sqlite database and execute queries:

sqlite> .schema items
CREATE TABLE "items" ("id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, "name" va
rchar(255), "basename" varchar(255), "size" integer);
sqlite> .output out1.txt
sqlite> select c,basename,round(size/(1024*1024)),l from (select *, count() as c
, group_concat(name) as l from items group by basename, size) a where c>1 order
by round(size/1000000) desc, c desc;

As result i've got csv-file (out1.txt) with list of doubles (files) sorted by size backwards.

Uses windows-specific function to get list of available disk drives.
